      <p>Hello! My name is Ka Kan Ho, and I'm thrilled to welcome you to my WDD 130 homepage. Originally from the bustling city of Hong Kong, I've always had a curiosity for the world and a passion for learning. Growing up in a multicultural environment has fueled my interest in exploring different cultures, languages, and traditions. Beyond my studies in web development, I'm an avid traveler and adventure seeker. Whether it's hiking through the lush greenery of the countryside or wandering the vibrant streets of a new city, I'm always seeking out new experiences and perspectives. In my downtime, you'll often find me with a camera in hand, capturing the beauty of the world around me through photography. I'm also a food enthusiast and love experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen, inspired by the diverse cuisines I encounter on my travels. I'm excited to share my journey in web development with you and invite you to join me as we explore the ever-evolving world of technology together.</p>
